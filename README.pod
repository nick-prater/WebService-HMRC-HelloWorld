    my $hmrc = WebService::HMRC::HelloWorld->new();

    # Hello World endpoint requires no authorisation
    my $result = $hmrc->hello_world()
    print $result->data->{message} if $result->is_success;

    # Hello Application endpoint requires a server token
    $hmrc->auth->server_token( $my_server_token );
    $result = $hmrc->hello_application();
    print $result->data->{message} if $result->is_success;

    # Hello User endpoint requires an access token

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl module to interact with the UK's HMRC Making Tax Digital
`Hello World` API. This is often used as a basic test of configuration
and credentials before using their more involved APIs for managing
corporate and personal tax affairs.

=head2 hello_world()

Retrieve a "Hello World" message. Does not require authorisation.

Returns a WebService::HMRC::Response object.


=cut

=head2 hello_application()

Retrieve a "Hello Application" message. This is an application-restricted
endpoint which requires that this module's server_token property be set.

Returns a WebService::HMRC::Response object.


=cut

=head2 hello_user()

Retrieve a "Hello User" message. This is a user-restricted endpoint.

Returns a WebService::HMRC::Response object.

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=head1 AUTHORISATION

Except for a small number of open endpoints, access to the HMRC APIs requires
appliction or user credentials. These must be obtained from HMRC. Application
credentials (and documentation) may be obtained from their
L<Developer Hub|https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation>

Access to the HMRC C<Hello World> service requires that an application
be registered with HMRC and 'subscribed' for this api.

This module allows all three of the possible authorisation types to be
exercised.

The C<hello_world()> method accesses an 'open' endpoint and does not
require authorisation.

The C<hello_application()> method accesses an 'application-restricted'
endpoint and therefore requires a C<server token> for authorisation. This is
issued when the application is registered with HMRC and may be retrieved
from the HMRC Developer Hub.

The C<hello_user()> method accesses a 'user-restricted' endpoint and
therefore requires an C<access token> for authorisation, obtained when
a user grants access to the application for this service.

For more details on obtaining and using access tokens, See
L<WebService::HMRC::Authenticate>.

Further information, application credentials and documentation may be obtained
from the
L<HMRC Developer Hub|https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation>.

=head1 TESTING

The basic tests are run as part of the installation instructions shown above
and do not require authorisation with HMRC. A call will be made to the open
C</hello/world> api endpoint, which requires a working internet connection
and that the HMRC sandbox test environment is operational.

Developer pre-release tests may be run with the following command:

    prove -l xt/

With a working internet connection and appropriate HMRC credentials, specified
as environment variables, interaction with the protected C<HelloWorld> endpoints
can be tested:

=over

=item * Test access to an application-restricted endpoint:

    HMRC_SERVER_TOKEN=[MY-SERVER-TOKEN] make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

=item * Test access to a user-restricted endpoint:

    HMRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=[MY-SERVER-TOKEN] make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
